    <h1>This is a blog, I guess.</h1>
    <h3>By <em>Jean-Baptiste Siraudin</em></h3>

    <p>
      I'm 24 and a student in computer science and graphics at Ecole
      polytechnique and Telecom ParisTech. I'm also kinda """<em>famous</em>"""
      on YouTube for a science popularization channel called <em>Scinema</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a blog, an online resume,
      whatever-you-want-that-feels-professionnal-enough, where I describe the
      main projects I worked on and I occasionnally write articles about stuff
      I'm interested in.

        The Shape of Movies - Computer Vision & Web development

    </h3>
    <p class="lessmargintop">
      A website about visualizing the colors of movies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I developed the offline program to get the color palette of every frame of
      a movie, with OpenCV. Then I made this website to have an interactive viz
      of my results, with MeteorJS, ReactJS and PixiJS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believe it or not, but the design inspiration for the website comes from
      me looking at maths papers online, all made with LaTeX. I sure hate LaTeX,
      but I really like the plainness it gives. I wanted to apply the same
      philosophy to movie analysis. Other cool projects like the
      <a href="https://thecolorsofmotion.com/">Colors of Motion</a> or
      <a href="http://cinemetrics.fredericbrodbeck.de/">Cinemetrics</a> inspired
      my focus on movie color palettes.

        Scinema - Videomaking

    </h3>
    <p class="lessmargintop">A YouTube channel about science + cinema.</p>
    <p>
      I make videos about science by using the world of cinema as a hook. How
      strong the wind has to be in order to make Mary Poppins fly? Is 4K really
      useful for movies? How to simulate water in VFX? That kind of stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scinema has over 120 000 subscribers and won the "Science popularization"
      award at the Frames Video Web Festival 2018 in France.
