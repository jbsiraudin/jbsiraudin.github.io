    <h1>This is a blog I guess.</h1>
    <h3>By <em>Jean-Baptiste Siraudin</em></h3>

    <p>I'm 24 and a student in computer science and graphics at Ecole polytechnique and Telecom ParisTech. I'm also kinda """<em>famous</em>""" on YouTube for a science popularization channel called <em>Scinema</em>.</p>
    <p>This is a blog, an online resume, whatever-you-want-that-feels-professionnal-enough, where I describe the main projects I worked on and I occasionnally write articles about stuff I'm interested in.</p>
    <p>Everything you need to contact me is at the bottom of this page.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3 class="lessmarginbottom">The Shape of Movies - Computer Vision & Web development</h3>
      <p class="lessmargintop">A <a href="https://www.theshapeofmovies.com/">website</a> about visualizing the colors of movies.</p>
      <p>I developed the offline program to get the color palette of every frame of a movie, with OpenCV. Then I made this website to have an interactive viz of my results, with MeteorJS, ReactJS and PixiJS.</p>
      <p>Believe it or not, but the design inspiration for the website comes from me looking at maths papers online, all made with LaTeX. I sure hate LaTeX, but I really like the plainness it gives. I wanted to apply the same philosophy to movie analysis. Other cool projects like the <a href="https://thecolorsofmotion.com/">Colors of Motion</a> or <a href="http://cinemetrics.fredericbrodbeck.de/">Cinemetrics</a> inspired my focus on movie color palettes.</p>
      
      <h3 class="lessmarginbottom">Scinema - Videomaking</h3>
      <p class="lessmargintop">A YouTube channel.</p>
