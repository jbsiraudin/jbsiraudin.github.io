Let's conjure the old god Combinatorics' most overpowered boon: the [_binomial coefficient_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient).

> [Combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics) is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures. It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics, from evolutionary biology to computer science, ... **and game design!**

Okay, I added the last part. But I'll show you that it's true in a few lines.

## Hades, a supergiant game

**Hades** is game made by _Supergiant games_, the team behind **Bastion**, **Transistor** and **Pyre**.

Description d'Hades, dire que tout le monde y a joué, et que si pas encore joué vous avez de la chance car vous pouvez le decouvrir

My favorite games are the ones where, like during a good standup comedy bit, every 30 seconds I'm thinking to myself "Oh, that's smart". And for me, **Hades** is the quintessential "oh that's smart" game.

Demo to calculate the number of arrangements of rooms (with variations of charon's well, treasure, mirrors) in one floor.

Demo to calculate the number of possibilities in the pact of punishment/DS3 chara builder with k parmi n

Code to enumerate all possibilities and assigning them an ID.

Conclude by citing all the other parameters affecting the difference nature of a run : the weapon (and its form) chosen, the boon builds, the keepsakes, ...
The smart thing is that progression is tied to the procedural generation so you keep discovering things, weapons, rooms, late in the game.

You progress too much? Let's make the world around progress then.

I suspect that 99% of players will have 100 runs maximum. And Hades has millions of different runs for you.
