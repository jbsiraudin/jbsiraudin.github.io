I love puns.

Making jokes with the language itself is fascinating to me: it defies and collides with our social rules of communications in order to explore uncharted shores of our brains. Without puns, no language would progress or evolve. Next time you make a pun, think of it as an active act of evolution of the human specy, and it might alleviate the pain of your probable social demise.

In french, "pun" is translated as "jeu de mots", litteraly "game of words". Indeed, a pun is the result of being playful with language, but what if you tried to translate this concept to video games?

the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language.

"the syntax of English" 2. the structure of statements in a computer language.
