I love puns.
</p>

Making jokes with the language itself is fascinating to me: it defies and collides with our social rules of communications in order to explore uncharted shores of our brains. Without puns, no language would progress or evolve. Next time you make a pun, think of it as an active act of evolution of the humankind, and it might alleviate the pain of your probable social demise.

In french, "pun" is translated as **"jeu de mots"**, litteraly **"game of words"**. Indeed, **a pun is the result of being playful with language**, but what if you tried to translate this concept to video games?

You could end up with something ressembling **Baba is you**.

> Baba Is You is a puzzle game where the rules you have to follow are present as physical objects in the game world. By manipulating the rules, you can change how the game works, repurpose things you find in the levels and cause surprising interactions! ([source](https://hempuli.com/baba/))

The core game mechanic of Baba is you is actually _the syntax of the English language_. Syntax is defined as the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. This definition works for linguistics as well as for computer science, where the syntax of a computer language defines the structure of statements, the "how-to write in ...".
