Let's distribute cards. But better.

import ContentDistribution from "../src/components/ContentDistribution/ContentDistribution"

## Let's talk about procedural generation

The content of Curious procedurally placed in the world the Ephemeral Zone system.
Hosts in the world can welcome various layouts, thus **populating the hosts with layouts in an important key to a well-designed world**.

The **use of randomness is essential** to keep the world fresh and
unpredictible for players, but we still need to have **a level of control on the populate algorithm to inject level design rules** (for pacing, logic, avoiding repetition).

Imagine here that each card is an Ephemeral Zone layout, and play with the different
populate algorithms.
