Here is a short article adapted from a [twitter üßµ thread üßµ I wrote](https://twitter.com/scinema_x/status/1609959007728373760) about the visual design of Demon Slayer, a very popular anime that I love.

**Disclaimer:** I'm not a professional artist or animator, the objective here is to analyze a scene from the show to extract design rules that could be applied in another context ... such as videogames!

## Behind the scene: Ufotable

**Ufotable** is now a very *very* popular animation studio. Probably even one of the most popular in the world, alongside Pixar or Ghibli, and all thanks to the enormous success of Demon Slayer.
The manga tells a classic and formulaic story, but is bursting with fascinating ideas fueling epic combats and one of the best sibling relationship I've seen in fiction.
It's funny, violent, epic, touching and all of that in the span of a few pages, juggling with wildely different tones effortlessly.

And the anime adaptation does all of that and more. It expands dramatically on all action scenes with the visual flare that Ufotable is known for. Based on a smart mix of 2D and 3D elements, well blended thanks to an immense compositing effort, forging a unique animation style.

<br/>

If you are more curious about Ufotable and how they work, I'd recommend [this interview of Yuichi Terao](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2018-01-10/interview-yuichi-terao-chief-of-ufotable-digital-team/.125658), compositing director at Ufotable. 

This 2D/3D DNA is of course found in Demon Slayer with smooth camera movements framing 2D characters in 3D environments or the different breathing techniques which are built from 2D animation painted on top of 3D renders.

Often very appealing but sometimes you end up with badly shaded flesh tentacles that don't seem like they belong in the frame.

<br/>

A lot of animators are contributing to the success of Ufotable, but the most famous one has to be Nozomu Abe, responsible of most of the "money" shots of the first 2 seasons of the show.

## The scene

But enough with the introduction! Let's take a shot and analyze it :

<br/>
<Video srcVideo="img/illustrations/demonslayer/0 - Base.mp4" legend="A shot from season 2 episode 9" />
<br/>

**Why this shot?**
1. Pretty simple framing so better to see the VFX and compositing techniques I want to talk about
2. Still very action-packed, with 5 attacks in 8 seconds!
3. It's a very personal thought, but I really like Inosuke's animation in the show

### Animation

Let's begin by looking at the animation frames to understand the base material. Most of the action is **animated at 12 frames per seconds**, one drawing per 2 frames, or "on twos".

But there are exceptions, the shot can dynamically change if the action needs it like this body rotation: 4 drawings in 4 frames, with motion blur directly drawn in. Other slowmo effects are also animated "on ones" to create a better smoothing feeling.

<CarouselImage srcImages={["img/illustrations/demonSlayer8.png", "img/illustrations/demonSlayer9.png", "img/illustrations/demonSlayer10.png", "img/illustrations/demonSlayer11.png"]} keyInit="demonSlayer3" />

The action follows a simple but effective rythm:
1. **Prepare (long)**
2. **Strike (short)**
3. **Relax (long)**

The strike itself is often made in just one frame, with a brutal change of pose:

<CarouselImage srcImages={["img/illustrations/demonSlayer12.png", "img/illustrations/demonSlayer13.png"]} keyInit="demonSlayer4" />

But the **preparation and effect of the strike are felt for a long long time on the character pose**. Here is a video to visualize what I mean (each point is a different drawing, red dots mark important pose changes) :

<br/>
<Video srcVideo="img/illustrations/demonslayer/5 - Animation.mp4" legend="Animation breakdown" />
<br/>

Demon Slayer's fight choregraphies are forged in this rythm, sometimes adding slowmo to artificially create breathing moments in very hectic scenes.

### Center framed

Now that we know what we work with, we can look at the first principle: center framed.

<br/>
<Video srcVideo="img/illustrations/demonslayer/1 - Framing.mp4" legend="Framing breakdown" />
<br/>

Action is compressed at the center of the frame so that the eye doesn't have to move too much, in order to follow what is happening without getting tired despite the intensity. This is something planned at the storyboard stage obviously. 

It's a classic principle in the action movies, easing a lot the editing work in post-production.
One of the best examples you can found is _Mad Max: Fury Road_: 

<br/>

### Camera Shake

Second technique still on the camera side: shake. This **camera shake is animated at 24fps**, helping to fluidify the overall 12 fps animation. Here is a visualization of the camera shake added on top of the basic animation:

<br/>
<Video srcVideo="img/illustrations/demonslayer/2 - CameraShake.mp4" legend="Camera Shake breakdown" />
<br/>

On top of it, on each impact, the **camera is bumped in the direction of the strike**. This shake add articifial motion blur which makes the impact frames even more chaotic (in a good way)! 

<Image srcImage="img/illustrations/demonSlayer14.png" altText="blurry-strike" legend="A blurry strike (it gets less blurry afterwards)" />

And here is the shot without any camera shake, immediately very different (stabilized by hand, forgive the small issues):

<br/>
<Video srcVideo="img/illustrations/demonslayer/2 - CameraShake Stab.mp4" legend="Shot without camera shake" />
<br/>

### Light

To see the third technique, we better switch the shot to black and white:

<br/>
<Video srcVideo="img/illustrations/demonslayer/0 - Base B&W.mp4" legend="Shot B&W" />
<br/>

With that, you should see how it **flashes** in intensity. 

Each sword strike is announced by a _glint_ on the sword, then reinforced by a light shape and sparks.
Conversely, each fabric strike is announced by a softer, blurrier light invading the screen.

<CarouselImage srcImages={["img/illustrations/demonSlayer12.png", "img/illustrations/demonSlayer15.png"]} keyInit="demonSlayer4" />

Beyond the form that the light takes, the **light color is also important: blue for the sword, purple for the enemy, gold for the sparks**. All of this combined gives us very clear signals about who is doing what and when.

<br/>
<Video srcVideo="img/illustrations/demonslayer/3 - Light.mp4" legend="Light breakdown" />
<br/>

### Impact Frames

The last light principle is quite widespread but Ufotable excels at it: impact frames. The idea is to **insert a particularly contrasted frame at the moment of impact to give it an additional visual _impact_**:

<CarouselImage srcImages={["img/illustrations/demonSlayer16.png", "img/illustrations/demonSlayer17.png", "img/illustrations/demonSlayer18.png"]} keyInit="demonSlayer5" />

Here the impact frames are rather timid, creating contrast by darkening areas, but if we go back to Nozomu Abe, he applies this technique absolutely all the time in his shots by **creating contrast thanks to the silhouettes** of the characters:

<br/>

<br/>

## Conclusion

There would still be a lot to say but I'm really not an expert so I'll stop there! The sound also plays a key role and I find the sound design of Ufotable quite fantastic on this series.

The purpose of all this visual and sound grammar, simple but perfectly applied, is to **base the viewing experience on the feeling of things rather than on their perfect understanding**.

These techniques are not magic, they only accentuate the initial animation, they do not replace anything. They interest me as a science communicator and game designer for their ‚Äúunconsciously didactic‚Äù side.

For example, the game Sify shares some of this DNA on its visual feedbacks:

The realization of Ufotable on Demon Slayer is not exempt from any reproach but remains very impressive for a series... and considering how the manga evolves, we are going to be entitled to beautiful things in animation until the end!
