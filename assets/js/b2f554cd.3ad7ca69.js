What is this?\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a short article adapted from a [twitter \ud83e\uddf5 thread \ud83e\uddf5 I wrote](https://twitter.com/scinema_x/status/1609959007728373760) about the visual design of Demon Slayer, a very popular anime that I love.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Disclaimer:** I\'m not a professional artist or animator, the objective here is to analyze a scene from the show to extract design rules that could be applied in another context ... such as videogames!\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Behind the scene: Ufotable\\r\\n\\r\\n**Ufotable** is now a very *very* popular animation studio. Probably even one of the most popular in the world, alongside Pixar or Ghibli, and all thanks to the enormous success of Demon Slayer.\\r\\nThe manga tells a classic and formulaic story, but is bursting with fascinating ideas fueling epic combats and one of the best sibling relationship I\'ve seen in fiction.\\r\\nIt\'s funny, violent, epic, touching and all of that in the span of a few pages, juggling with wildely different tones effortlessly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the anime adaptation does all of that and more. It expands dramatically on all action scenes with the visual flare that Ufotable is known for. Based on a smart mix of 2D and 3D elements, well blended thanks to an immense compositing effort, forging a unique animation style.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Iframe srcUrl=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yo1Rn8za-Uo\\" legend=\\"Breakdown of a Heaven\'s Feel shot, the prior work of Ufotable before Demon Slayer\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are more curious about Ufotable and how they work, I\'d recommend [this interview of Yuichi Terao](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2018-01-10/interview-yuichi-terao-chief-of-ufotable-digital-team/.125658), compositing director at Ufotable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis 2D/3D DNA is of course found in Demon Slayer with smooth camera movements framing 2D characters in 3D environments or the different breathing techniques which are built from 2D animation painted on top of 3D renders.\\r\\n\\r\\n<CarouselImage srcImages={[\\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer1.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer2.png\\"]} keyInit=\\"demonSlayer1\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nOften very appealing but sometimes you end up with badly shaded flesh tentacles that don\'t seem like they belong in the frame.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer3.png\\" altText=\\"flesh-tentacles\\" legend=\\"Not their best work...\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of animators are contributing to the success of Ufotable, but the most famous one has to be Nozomu Abe, responsible of most of the \\"money\\" shots of the first 2 seasons of the show.\\r\\n\\r\\n<CarouselImage srcImages={[\\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer4.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer5.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer6.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer7.png\\"]} keyInit=\\"demonSlayer2\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\n## The scene\\r\\n\\r\\nBut enough with the introduction! Let\'s take a shot and analyze it :\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Video srcVideo=\\"img/illustrations/demonslayer/0 - Base.mp4\\" legend=\\"A shot from season 2 episode 9\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n**Why this shot?**\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Pretty simple framing so better to see the VFX and compositing techniques I want to talk about\\r\\n2. Still very action-packed, with 5 attacks in 8 seconds!\\r\\n3. It\'s a very personal thought, but I really like Inosuke\'s animation in the show\\r\\n\\r\\n### Animation\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s begin by looking at the animation frames to understand the base material. Most of the action is **animated at 12 frames per seconds**, one drawing per 2 frames, or \\"on twos\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there are exceptions, the shot can dynamically change if the action needs it like this body rotation: 4 drawings in 4 frames, with motion blur directly drawn in. Other slowmo effects are also animated \\"on ones\\" to create a better smoothing feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\n<CarouselImage srcImages={[\\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer8.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer9.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer10.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer11.png\\"]} keyInit=\\"demonSlayer3\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action follows a simple but effective rythm:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Prepare (long)**\\r\\n2. **Strike (short)**\\r\\n3. **Relax (long)**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strike itself is often made in just one frame, with a brutal change of pose:\\r\\n\\r\\n<CarouselImage srcImages={[\\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer12.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer13.png\\"]} keyInit=\\"demonSlayer4\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the **preparation and effect of the strike are felt for a long long time on the character pose**. Here is a video to visualize what I mean (each point is a different drawing, red dots mark important pose changes) :\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Video srcVideo=\\"img/illustrations/demonslayer/5 - Animation.mp4\\" legend=\\"Animation breakdown\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nDemon Slayer\'s fight choregraphies are forged in this rythm, sometimes adding slowmo to artificially create breathing moments in very hectic scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Center framed\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that we know what we work with, we can look at the first principle: center framed.\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Video srcVideo=\\"img/illustrations/demonslayer/1 - Framing.mp4\\" legend=\\"Framing breakdown\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nAction is compressed at the center of the frame so that the eye doesn\'t have to move too much, in order to follow what is happening without getting tired despite the intensity. This is something planned at the storyboard stage obviously.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s a classic principle in the action movies, easing a lot the editing work in post-production.\\r\\nOne of the best examples you can found is *Mad Max: Fury Road*:\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Iframe srcUrl=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CR7ejkmf8Y4\\" legend=\\"DP John Seale about Mad Max Fury Road\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\n### Camera Shake\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond technique still on the camera side: shake. This **camera shake is animated at 24fps**, helping to fluidify the overall 12 fps animation. Here is a visualization of the camera shake added on top of the basic animation:\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Video srcVideo=\\"img/illustrations/demonslayer/2 - CameraShake.mp4\\" legend=\\"Camera Shake breakdown\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nOn top of it, on each impact, the **camera is bumped in the direction of the strike**. This shake add articifial motion blur which makes the impact frames even more chaotic (in a good way)!\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer14.png\\" altText=\\"blurry-strike\\" legend=\\"A blurry strike (it gets less blurry afterwards)\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here is the shot without any camera shake, immediately very different (stabilized by hand, forgive the small issues):\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Video srcVideo=\\"img/illustrations/demonslayer/2 - CameraShake Stab.mp4\\" legend=\\"Shot without camera shake\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n### Light\\r\\n\\r\\nTo see the third technique, we better switch the shot to black and white:\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Video srcVideo=\\"img/illustrations/demonslayer/0 - Base B&W.mp4\\" legend=\\"Shot B&W\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that, you should see how it **flashes** in intensity.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach sword strike is announced by a *glint* on the sword, then reinforced by a light shape and sparks.\\r\\nConversely, each fabric strike is announced by a softer, blurrier light invading the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\n<CarouselImage srcImages={[\\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer12.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer15.png\\"]} keyInit=\\"demonSlayer4\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the form that the light takes, the **light color is also important: blue for the sword, purple for the enemy, gold for the sparks**. All of this combined gives us very clear signals about who is doing what and when.\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Video srcVideo=\\"img/illustrations/demonslayer/3 - Light.mp4\\" legend=\\"Light breakdown\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n### Impact Frames\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last light principle is quite widespread but Ufotable excels at it: impact frames. The idea is to **insert a particularly contrasted frame at the moment of impact to give it an additional visual *impact***:\\r\\n\\r\\n<CarouselImage srcImages={[\\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer16.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer17.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/demonSlayer18.png\\"]} keyInit=\\"demonSlayer5\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the impact frames are rather timid, creating contrast by darkening areas, but if we go back to Nozomu Abe, he applies this technique absolutely all the time in his shots by **creating contrast thanks to the silhouettes** of the characters:\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Video srcVideo=\\"img/illustrations/demonslayer/AbeImpact.mp4\\" legend=\\"Impact frames in Nozomu Abe shots\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nThere would still be a lot to say but I\'m really not an expert so I\'ll stop there! The sound also plays a key role and I find the sound design of Ufotable quite fantastic on this series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe purpose of all this visual and sound grammar, simple but perfectly applied, is to **base the viewing experience on the feeling of things rather than on their perfect understanding**.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese techniques are not magic, they only accentuate the initial animation, they do not replace anything. They interest me as a science communicator and game designer for their \u201cunconsciously didactic\u201d side.\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Video srcVideo=\\"img/illustrations/demonslayer/4 - Explanation.mp4\\" legend=\\"Shot full breakdown\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the game Sify shares some of this DNA on its visual feedbacks:\\r\\n\\r\\n<CarouselImage srcImages={[\\"img/illustrations/sifu1.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/sifu2.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/sifu3.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/sifu4.png\\"]} keyInit=\\"sifu1\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nThe realization of Ufotable on Demon Slayer is not exempt from any reproach but remains very impressive for a series... and considering how the manga evolves, we are going to be entitled to beautiful things in animation until the end!\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"img/illustrations/demonSlayerFinal.png\\" altText=\\"ufotable\\" legend=\\"Let them cook :)\\" />"},{"id":"spiderman-dolly","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/spiderman-dolly","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-20-spiderman-dolly.md","title":"The almost unintentional dolly of Insomniac\'s Spidercam","description":"Let\'s face it: Alfred Hitchcock didn\'t plan for this.","date":"2021-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 20, 2021","tags":[{"label":"game design","permalink":"/blog/tags/game-design"},{"label":"3C","permalink":"/blog/tags/3-c"},{"label":"camera","permalink":"/blog/tags/camera"}],"readingTime":6.84,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"spiderman-dolly","title":"The almost unintentional dolly of Insomniac\'s Spidercam","draft":false,"hide_table_of_contents":true,"tags":["game design","3C","camera"]},"prevItem":{"title":"The visual design of Demon Slayer\'s combats","permalink":"/blog/demon-slayer-visual-grammar"},"nextItem":{"title":"Sentences?

I remembered the constant buzz outside my window, the shitty subway, the incredible restaurants and the many drunk parties where I\'d leave convinced that I could just go back home by foot even though I was in the middle of Brooklyn at 3am and my rented place was in East Harlem, 15 kilometers away.\\r\\n\\r\\n**That\'s the main thing you quickly learn about New York: it\'s huge**. I spent the majority of my life around Paris and its suburbs, an arguably big city, but I was still surprised by the scale of New York. I\'m used to walk a lot in Paris, and you can go nearly anywhere in about an hour of walk, something not really possible in New York with its lengthy rectangular shape. The height of the buildings, the length of the streets, ... it was a change of perspective about how I could move in an urban space.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Talking about perspective, Spider-Man\'s traversal gameplay was quite the change ... and literally too.**\\r\\n\\r\\n<Iframe srcUrl=\\"https://giphy.com/embed/0m5fac1iC8gNhjEUzV\\" legend=\\"Focus on the buildings ahead.\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the first thing I noticed when I started swinging: **the street seems to elongate itself with the acceleration of each swing.** Time to investigate this theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the GDC talk [Concrete Jungle Gym: Building Traversal in Marvel\'s Spider-Man](https://youtu.be/OEaGEaCUq3g), gameplay programmer Doug Sheahan explains the requirements on a _dynamic camera_ for their mandate **\\"Play as a superhero movie feels\\"**:\\r\\n\\r\\n> The look and feel of swinging needed to be fluid, fast, exciting and especially _cinematic_. We needed a camera that helped translate all that high-flying acrobatics and velocity into a really visceral experience for the player, something that they could just feel in their gut.\\r\\n\\r\\n**So from a minimim amount of player input, all that speed and that perfect pendulum physics needs to be communicated to the player visually.** They are doing a lot of smart dynamic framing, like adjusting the camera pitch to the tangent of the pendulum arc as well as moving the character screen position up and down along the arc to help sensing the verticality of the pendulum.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut **for feeling the speed**, even if sound wooshes and motion will help immensely, **Insomniac developed other visual cues in order to sell changes of speed specifically.**\\r\\n\\r\\n**Two parameters are dynamically increased in real-time according to the character\'s speed: FoV and follow distance** (in cinematography language: the focal length and the distance between the camera and the character).\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Video srcVideo=\\"img/illustrations/Dolly3.mp4\\" legend=\\"Doug blesses us with debug display footage showing the dynamic control of FoV and follow distance.\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice how every web shoot triggers a bump in FoV, giving us for an instant ... **a Dolly Zoom**.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"img/illustrations/vertigo.gif\\" legend=\\"Vertigo (1958)\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nThe **Dolly Zoom** is a camera shot invented by the cameraman Irmin Roberts for **Alfred Hitchcock\'s Vertigo**, initially in order to convey the feeling of **acrophobia** (intensely felt by the character played by James Stewart in the film).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principle behind the shot is very simple: **zoom in with the lens while simultaneously moving the camera backwards \u2026 or vice versa.**\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Contra-zoom_aka_dolly_zoom_animation.gif\\" legend=\\"A Dolly Zoom setup\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Vertigo, it has been used countless times in other movies. Unfortunately, it\'s often used because it looks cool rather than using it because it conveys a particular emotion in the context of the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the [best dolly zooms of all time](https://vimeo.com/84548119), you\'ll find the ones from **Jaws, Raging Bull or La Haine**:\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"https://c.tenor.com/aGjB0c7wgOYAAAAC/jaws-dolly.gif\\" legend=\\"Jaws (1975)\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"https://i.gifer.com/5ZGr.gif\\" legend=\\"Raging Bull (1980)\\"/>\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Fellowship-of-the-Ring-dolly-zoom.gif\\" legend=\\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/a4df39f5cc65ce932ae05d6d12e3f962/tumblr_nukogo6nqd1td9opyo1_400.gifv\\" legend=\\"La Haine (1995)\\"/>\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom spotting a deadly shark, the climax of a box fight and the turning point for a group of friends, **all those shots use the Dolly Zoom for a particular effect and a particular meaning.**\\r\\n\\r\\n**La Haine** is a movie split in two parts: first, we follow the characters in their hometown, a place they are familiar and comfortable with, shot with short focal length cameras on steadycams. But when the characters head to Paris, this Dolly Zoom shifts the camera to use a long focal length for the rest of the film, squashing perspectives and visually feedbacking the uneasiness of the characters in this environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can spot dolly zooms in the camera work of video games too, sometimes as a direct recreation of the Vertigo shot.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Iframe srcUrl=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpTI8wpKDk8\\" legend=\\"In The Last of Us 2, Abby is terrified of heights.\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{fontSize: 24, textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: 72 }}>\\r\\nBut why do we even have a Dolly effect in Spider-Man?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principle behind the Dolly effect we see in Spider-Man or Vertigo is to **zoom out with the lens while moving the camera forward**. But as Doug Sheahan showed us, **the FoV and the Follow Distance both increase as the acceleration kick in: isn\'t this the wrong setup?**.\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Iframe srcUrl=\\"https://giphy.com/embed/0m5fac1iC8gNhjEUzV\\" legend=\\"Do you see it better now?\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nWell no, it\'s still the correct setup. **As you saw in the previous shots, the subject of the dolly zoom in cinema is static, whereas Spider-Man is moving forward at 80 miles an hour (not a real value).**\\r\\n\\r\\n**So, even if the follow distance increases, the camera is still going forward while the FoV increases in world coordinates**: this is what creates the Dolly Zoom. The increase in follow-distance actually helps maintaining the Dolly effect as long as possible since it briefly decreases the forward speed of the camera in world coordinates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe high forward speed of Spider-Man also explains why the effect fades out so quickly and naturally too.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Another great feature of Spider-Man improving the Dolly effect is Manhattan.** Indeed the Dolly Zoom is particularly effective in corridors, when you can observe the walls on the side changing length:\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Poltergeist-dolly-zoom.gif\\" legend=\\"Poltergeist (1982)\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nThe geometry of Manhattan coupled with Spider-Man swing high rythm creates this Dolly heartbeat, where you\'re constantly feeling the rush of an acceleration.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Iframe srcUrl=\\"https://giphy.com/embed/uLMttwMsaBIEPKmEEU\\" legend=\\"Next, give us the glider of the Green Goblin please.\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\n**Spider-Man\'s camera is the quintessential example of creating a positive interaction between classic optics effects and all the properties of its world and its character.** And I can\'t wait to see more soon!\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"https://vashivisuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Halt-Catch-Fire-Zoom.gif\\" legend=\\"Halt and Catch Fire (2014-2017)\\" />\\r\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_zoom\\r\\nhttps://vashivisuals.com/evolution-dolly-zoom/\\r\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_zoom\\r\\nhttps://giphy.com/explore/the-dolly-zoom\\r\\n\\r\\n<Iframe srcUrl=\\"https://www.shadertoy.com/embed/tljcDK?gui=false&t=0&paused=true&muted=true\\" />\\r\\n --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to do a Dolly at home, I\'ll give you a bit of help. An effective dolly zoom keeps the subject exactly at the same size, while everything else scales. Thus, if we position our center on the subject, if we want to know the new camera position $x_{1}$ from the initial camera position $x_{0}$, the initial fov angle $\\\\alpha$ and the zoom factor $z$ we want for our Dolly, the formula is:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\nx_{1} = \\\\frac{tan(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2})}{tan(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2*z})}*x_{0} = a*x_{0}\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see below how $a$ evolves according to the zoom factor on this drawing:\\r\\n\\r\\n<Dolly />\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{fontSize: 12}}>All the Spider-Man additional gameplay of this article was extracted from <a href=\\"https://youtu.be/eEPG4TMhwtk\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">this video</a>.</p>"},{"id":"sentences-rule","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/sentences-rule","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-20-sentences-rule.md","title":"Sentences?

Because here, you\'re not pushing boxes, **you\'re pushing _nouns_, _verbs_, ... _words_ into or out of _sentences_ that controls the rules of the level**.\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"https://i.imgur.com/VIy5nNi.gif\\" legend=\\"Walls will stop Baba until the rule \'WALL IS STOP\' is dismantled.\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, the core game system of **Baba Is You** is actually _the syntax of the English language_. Syntax is defined as the _arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language_. This definition works for linguistics as well as for computer science, where the syntax of a computer language defines the structure of statements, the \\"how-to write in ...\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n**Baba Is You use the internal rules of the English language as the pillar on top of which players will form sentences by moving some blocks and assembling them in the correct order**. So it\'s more that just using words: every game uses words, just by the fact that you have to read text while playing, but they can be easily translated to any language whereas **Baba Is You**\'s mechanics are so deeply rooted in English that a translation seems impossible without changing the whole game.\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"img/illustrations/babaIsYou2.jpg\\" legend=\\"A level can accumulate of lots of rules.\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the end goal is not to make elaborate litterature, but to manipulate **rules**: rules that controls who the player is, what they can push, what the obstacles are and even what the winning objective is.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd **Baba Is You** encourages you to be creative, to bend the levels with literal _puns_ in order to solve its puzzles. The game is often built for this, forcing you to adopt a particularly non-sensical solution in order to create a \\"surprise\\", an \\"epiphany\\" moment when you discover the trick you needed. It\'s not my favorite type of puzzle, because it creates a lot of frustrating moments where you\'re just stuck on a level, missing the _mental trick_ to go through at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"img/illustrations/babaIsYou1.png\\" legend=\\"If \'WALLS IS BABA AND BABA IS YOU\' then all the walls becomes Baba and you can control all of them at the same time.\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I still love **Baba Is You** because I\'m obsessed with **rules**. Engaging the player in the definition of the game, writing and rewriting the game as you progress, ... I can\'t think of a more fascinating design sandbox. This is the kind of sandbox where you can profit or suffer from _design puns_, where the game is playful with itself and the player.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my absolute favorite implementation of the **rules** philosophy is in the mobile roguelike **Seven Scrolls**:\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"img/illustrations/7scrolls0.png\\" legend=\\"In Seven Scrolls, you\'re a Monk trying to survive in a dungeon. Sort of a follow-up to The Name of the Rose.\\" />\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n**Seven Scrolls** is a turn-based strategy puzzler, where you can move in 4 directions, shoot beams to fight and kill monsters. Collect the key to unlock the access to the next floor and move to the stairs to go there. Simple.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on each floor, you can also collect **_scrolls_**, up to seven of them of course, which unlocks a particular **_spell_**. A **_spell_** is structured like so:\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{fontSize: 21, textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\"}}>\\r\\nWhen <span style={{color: \\"#ff851b\\"}}>[trigger]</span> happens, <span style={{color: \\"#ff4136\\"}}>[target]</span> receives <span style={{color: \\"#39c7cc\\"}}>[effect]</span>.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Each <span style={{color: \\"#ff851b\\"}}>[trigger]</span> and <span style={{color: \\"#39c7cc\\"}}>[effect]</span> is randomly picked from a different list that the player uncovers as things progress and as spells are picked up. The <span style={{color: \\"#ff4136\\"}}>[target]</span> is always the Monk or a Monster.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<CarouselImage srcImages={[\\"img/illustrations/7scrolls1.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/7scrolls2.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/7scrolls3.png\\", \\"img/illustrations/7scrolls4.png\\"]} keyInit=\\"7scrolls\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nQuickly, **you\'ll find yourself chaining or avoiding triggers to use your spells in the most effective way**. You can also trigger a spell manually, with the caveat that its scroll will be removed after use but it\'s necessary to make room for new ones or discard unwanted ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this really simple setup, built around the most basic syntax you could think of, this mobile game provides a variety of gameplay and strategies often not reached by many AAA games. **Exploration in the game becomes also an exploration of the rules of the game, thus half of the game is learning what you can do.**\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven Scrolls is a fantastic example of a **simple but not simplistic game system**.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Let\'s make a simple rules system\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s imagine a game where players find scrolls during their exploration of the level.

The team grew from 4 developers at the time of **Bastion** to nearly 20 for the development of **Hades**, and that growth was followed by _larger_ and better games. And if I emphasized the adjective _larger_, it is because _Supergiant games_ are always very generous when it comes to the content of their games.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Hades** is a very large yet super polished game, pushing the standards of the industry altogether (so much that its relatively low price at 20\u20ac was a subject of heated conversations in the indie community).\\r\\n\\r\\n<Iframe srcUrl=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/91t0ha9x0AE\\" legend=\\"Official Animated Trailer for Hades\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a roguelike, **Hades** is focused on **replayability**: each run must be new, yet using the same grammar so that the player can still learn the game and get better at it. Procedural generation is essential to both the design of a roguelike (to keep things fresh yet familiar) and the production team.\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: \\"20px\\", fontSize: \\"18px\\" }}>\\r\\n  You want to create a game with an infinite amount of runs,<br/>\\r\\n  with a very finite amount of time and resources.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\nScoping this kind of project is a tough task, so let\'s crunch some numbers!\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### The size of Hell\\r\\n\\r\\nOn of the biggest task to tackle in a videogame like **Hades** is to create its world. _Supergiant_ has a lot of experience in that matter, and were extra smart about designing their own version of a procedural Hell.\\r\\n\\r\\n**The player explores the world by stepping into a succession of rooms across 4 biomes : Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium and the Temple of Styx.** The room before each biome is a boss room, containing a particularly tough but constant challenge, the boss itself and the layout of its room remaining unchanged across runs (well up until the endgame starts). What _does_ change in each biome is the rooms you cross before the boss.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Supergiant_ is using a technique [I described before as **content distribution**](/blog/content-distribution) : Hell is not redrawn from scratch every time Zagreus steps into Tartarus _yet again_, Hell is pulling rooms from an existing library and linking them with doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis technique is great because it automatically gives you a distributed design process split in two layers : **designing individuals rooms** and **designing the rules of assemblage**. Even then, it doesn\'t mean that it becomes easy: it will take many iterations to nail the level design of the rooms, artists will spend days preping every room into looking gorgeous, a programmer will write and rewrite dozens of times the algorithm of generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the standard rooms of the first 3 biomes ([source](https://www.hades-guides.ovh/index.php/chamber-layout/)):\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: 20, marginBottom: 10, fontSize: \\"24px\\" }}>\\r\\n  24 rooms of Tartarus\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<HadesCarousel world=\\"Tartarus\\" length={24} />\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: 20, marginBottom: 10, fontSize: \\"24px\\" }}>\\r\\n  11 rooms of Asphodel\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<HadesCarousel world=\\"Asphodel\\" length={11} />\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: 20, marginBottom: 10, fontSize: \\"24px\\" }}>\\r\\n  13 rooms of Elysium\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<HadesCarousel world=\\"Elysium\\" length={13} />\\r\\n\\r\\n**The number of rooms you will cross in those 3 biomes is fixed for each run** :\\r\\n\\r\\n- Tartarus starts in chamber 1, ends in chamber 12 (13 is the end shop).\\r\\n- Asphodel starts in chamber 16, ends in chamber 22 (23 is the end shop).\\r\\n- Elysium starts in chamber 26, ends in chamber 34 (35 is the end shop).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Tartarus, that means that **we have to pick 12 rooms in our 24 rooms library**.\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: 20, fontSize: \\"21px\\" }}>\\r\\n  In this context, how many different Tartarus configurations exist?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--\\r\\n// https://fr.wikiversity.org/wiki/Combinatoire/Arrangements_sans_r%C3%A9p%C3%A9tition\\r\\nhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrangement\\r\\nhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principe_des_tiroirs\\r\\n--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--\\r\\nhttps://www.alloprof.qc.ca/fr/eleves/bv/mathematiques/les-permutations-les-arrangements-et-les-combinai-m1346\\r\\n\\r\\nArrangement = order is important\\r\\nCombination = order is not important\\r\\n\\r\\n --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the order of the rooms is important, the combinatrics _boon_ we are going to use is **permutation**, an ordered arrangement of elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore specifically, we are trying to count the arrangements of 12 rooms taken from a set of 24 rooms, so we are talking about the k-permutations of n, where k is 12 and n is 24.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo discover the formula giving us the answer, we have to think of what happens when we are generating an arrangement. We start with our n rooms and the first thing to do is:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Choosing our first room. **I have exactly _n_ choices at this point.** So I\'m choosing a room at random and taking it out of the library.\\r\\n- Ok so now let\'s choose a second room. **I have _n-1_ choices now**, because I can\'t choose the element I picked as the first room.\\r\\n- On the third room, **I will have _n-2_ choices**, because I can\'t pick the first two elements.\\r\\n- You get the idea: on the room n\xb0X, **I will have _n-(X-1) = n-X+1_ choices**.\\r\\n- On room n\xb0k, **I will have _n-k+1_ choices**.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final number of arrangements is the product of the possible choices at each step. Thus: $A_{n}^k = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*(n-k+2)*(n-k+1)$.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this formula can be simplified with factorials like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\nA_{n}^k = \\\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\n$k$ is the number of rooms to choose, $n$ is the total number of rooms\\r\\n\\r\\nSo in the case of Tartarus:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\\\scriptsize A_{24}^{12} = \\\\frac{24!}{(24-12)!} = \\\\frac{24!}{12!} = 1295295050649600\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of Asphodel:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\\\scriptsize A_{11}^{6} = \\\\frac{11!}{(11-6)!} = \\\\frac{11!}{5!} = 332640\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of Elysium:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\\\scriptsize A_{13}^{8} = \\\\frac{13!}{(13-8)!} = \\\\frac{13!}{5!} = 51891840\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\nJust for the first biome, we have a number with 16 digits. And the situation is even more crazy since each chamber can be mirrored, each chamber can welcome different challenges, each chamber can contain or not chests and pots. And I don\'t count the special chambers or internal mini-bosses in the mix. **In any case, the real number of arrangements is of course higher**.\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: 20, fontSize: \\"21px\\" }}>\\r\\n  With those kind of numbers,<br/>a player will never pass through the same version of Hell.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can set up your own numbers and calculate the number of arrangements directly below (until it goes over the maximum integer authorized by JS):\\r\\n\\r\\n<Arrangements />\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\n\\r\\nI find this calculus fun for hero-based arena games, like _League of Legends_ or _Rainbow Six Siege_.

The game is too easy for you! Let\'s make the game progress then. But on the contrary to most \\"high difficulty\\" modes you can encounter, **Hades** lets you choose the stick to be beaten with.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, the **_Pact of Punishment_** lets you customize the increased difficulty of your run through control of many parameters of the game : health/speed/power of your enemies, alternate versions of the bosses, time limits, ... The smart thing here is to tye progression with the procedural generation of the dungeon in order to keep discovering things, weapons, rooms, etc late in the game.\\r\\n\\r\\n**All of those changes adds up in a single value exposed to players**: <span style={{fontWeight: \\"bold\\", color: \\"red\\"}}>heat</span>. And so naturally, the game encourages you to complete the game with increasing levels of heat, for every weapon form there is, each new heat level giving access to precious resources that you can only loot once per level of heat and per weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiving the players the choice of their challenge is a genius move, as it involves them much more in the conception of the rules of the game, something utterly motivating. I believe you\'ll see this approach being used more and more by the industry.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"https://interfaceingame.com/wp-content/uploads/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-select-difficulty-1920x1080.jpg\\" legend=\\"Shadow the Tomb Raider drops the overall difficulty [Easy, Normal, Hard] for something more granular on its 3 gameplay pillars: combat, exploration, puzzle.\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: 20, fontSize: \\"21px\\" }}>\\r\\n  But exactly how many choices does this kind of menu create for players? How many configurations of the <i>Pact of Punishment</i> exist?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\nWell for the total number of configurations, the answer is really easy to compute. As reminder here is a summary of the **_Pact of Punishment_** options, and how many \\"ranks\\" there is per option:\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n| Condition            | Ranks | Condition           | Ranks  |\\r\\n| -------------------- | ----- | ------------------- | ------ |\\r\\n| Hard Labor           | 5     | Underworld Customs  | 1      |\\r\\n| Lasting Consequences | 4     | Forced Overtime     | 2      |\\r\\n| Convenience Fee      | 2     | Heightened Security | 1      |\\r\\n| Jury Summons         | 3     | Routine Inspection  | 4      |\\r\\n| Extreme Measures     | 4     | Damage Control      | 2      |\\r\\n| Calisthenics Program | 2     | Approval Process    | 2      |\\r\\n| Benefits Package     | 2     | Tight Deadline      | 3      |\\r\\n| Middle Management    | 1     |                     |        |\\r\\n|                      |       | **Total**           | **37** |\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nLike before, let\'s think about what happens when a player makes a configuration:\\r\\n\\r\\n- On the first option \\"Hard Labor\\", **I have _5+1=6_ choices**, the 5 ranks and the choice to not activate this option at all.\\r\\n- On the second option \\"Lasting Consequences\\", **I have _4+1=5_ choices**, the 4 ranks and the choice to not activate this option at all.\\r\\n- You get the idea: on option n\xb0X, **I have _n+1_ choices**, _n_ being the number of ranks possible in this option.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final number of configurations is the product of the possible choices at each step. Thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\\\scriptsize Pact = 6*5*3*4*5*3*3*2*2*3*2*5*3*3*4 = 69984000\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\n**Close to 70 millions possibilities!** Not bad for just 15 options!\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can set up your own options and calculate the total number of configurations directly below:\\r\\n\\r\\n<Configurations />\\r\\n\\r\\nSo calculating the total is pretty easy right? What if I want something a bit more subtle now?\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the <span style={{fontWeight: \\"bold\\", color: \\"red\\"}}>heat</span> value exposition, the **_Pact of Punishment_** looks a lot like a point attribution system. Something that you would see in for a character build in an RPG for example.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Disco-Elysium12152020-023713-4326.jpg\\" legend=\\"Disco Elysium makes you spend skill points in variety of sub-categories.\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Dark-Souls07152020-084348-29696.jpg\\" legend=\\"In Dark Souls, you spend souls to level up, and you redistribute your level points in the properties of your character: Vitality, Attunement, Endurance, ...\\"/>\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, according to me, an interesting question would be:\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: 20, fontSize: \\"21px\\" }}>\\r\\n  At a given <span style={{fontWeight: \\"bold\\", color: \\"red\\"}}>heat</span>, how many configurations<br/> of the <i>Pact of Punishment</i> exist?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause each option has a different maximum attributed, it would make the whole calculation very very complex, so we\'ll make this much more simpler.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s say I have 10 points to distribute into 5 differents categories like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n<SimplePointDistribute />\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: 20, fontSize: \\"21px\\" }}>\\r\\n  How many point distributions exist?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\nTo discover this formula, **we\'re gonna change the problem again and make it look like another problem where we might know the answer.**\\r\\n\\r\\nFundamentally speaking, a distribution is an addition of 5 elements that equals to 10. So the question becomes:\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: 20, fontSize: \\"21px\\" }}>\\r\\n  How many ways to cut 10 in 5 exist?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\nNow let\'s say I represent 10 with 10 symbols such as this star $*$. A distribution becomes something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\n***+*+***+**+*\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd other solutions might look this:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\n******+*+*+*+*\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\n**+**+**+**+**\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\n**********++++\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for that matter, we can replace the $*$ symbol with a letter and the $+$ sign with another letter and the solutions will stay the same:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\nAAAAAABABABABA\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\nAABAABAABAABAA\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\nAAAAAAAAAABBBB\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the problem becomes:\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: 20, fontSize: \\"21px\\" }}>\\r\\n  How many words can we make with 10 A and 4 B?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\nOr in a more mathematic way:\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: 20, fontSize: \\"21px\\" }}>\\r\\n  How many permutations of 14 symbols (10 * and 4 +) exist?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mathematics, we\'re saying that we\'re looking for the number of **permutations with repetitions**.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo discover this formula we first have to look at a simpler case where all the elements are distincts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf all the $n$ elements are distincts (so **permutations without repetitions**), let\'s analyze what happens when we generate an arrangement:\\r\\n\\r\\n- On the first pick, **I have exactly _n_ choices**.\\r\\n- On the second pick, **I have exactly _n-1_ choices**, because I can\'t choose\\r\\n- On the third pick, **I will have _n-2_ choices**, because I can\'t pick the first two elements.\\r\\n- You get the idea: on the pick n\xb0X, **I will have _n-(X-1) = n-X+1_ choices**.\\r\\n- On the last pick, **I will have _1_ choice**.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final number of arrangements is the product of the possible choices at each step. Thus: $P_{n} = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1$.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this formula is quite literaly:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\nP_{n} = n!\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now, **let\'s reintroduce the fact that the $n$ elements are such that there are $n_{1}$ identical objects and $n_{2}$ other identical objects and $n_{1}+n_{2}=n$** (in our example $n_{1}=10$ and $n_{2}=4$).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor each of the $P_{n} = n!$ permutations, **we can permute the $n_{1}$ identical objects and the arrangement would be the same**. And since we have $n_{1}$ elements, there are $n_{1}!$ ways to permute those elements without changing the arrangement. Same thing for the other $n_{2}$ elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the number of permutations of $n$ elements with $n_{1}$ identical objects and $n_{2}$ other identical objects is:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\\\scriptsize P(n_{1}, n_{2}) = \\\\frac{(n_{1}+n_{2})!}{n_{1}!n_{2}!}\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, if I have $n$ points and $k$ categories, the number of possible distributions is:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\nP(n, k-1) = \\\\frac{(n+k-1)!}{n!(k-1)!}\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a consequence, the number of distributions of 10 points in 5 categories is:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\\\scriptsize P(10, 5-1) = P(10, 4) = \\\\frac{14!}{10!4!} = 1001\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, passing a thousand possibilities with those small numbers seems crazy, and I\'ll address this point in the next part. In the meantime, you can set up your own numbers and calculate the number of permutations directly below:\\r\\n\\r\\n<Permutations />\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info\\r\\n\\r\\nAn interesting thing to note here is that:\\r\\n\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\\\scriptsize P(n, k-1) = \\\\frac{(n+k-1)!}{n!(k-1)!} = \\\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1} = C_{n+k-1}^{k-1}\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\r\\nThe [_binomial coefficient_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) finds its way into our calculus (as it usually does).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Plot twist: these numbers are stupid\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\'t present all the systems of **Hades** that introduces differences for each run: the mirror of night, the weapons, the keepsakes, the boons, ... with everything combined, **this game offers more than billions of billions of variations**.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, the hard truth:\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bolder\\", marginTop: 20, fontSize: \\"21px\\", color: \\"crimson\\" }}>\\r\\n  The mathematical variations are <span style={{color: \\"red\\"}}>not</span> game design variations.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe numbers I developed do not represent the _**variety feel**_ of players in **Hades**. It doesn\'t mean that it\'s completely useless, it means that we need to reinterpret them a bit. And my first argument is:\\r\\n\\r\\n### The majority of mathematical variations are insignificant\\r\\n\\r\\nThe size of Hell doesn\'t matter that much because players won\'t make a huge deal out of the fact that they won\'t cross the same rooms in the exact same order as their last run. What is important for sizing Hell is how many rooms do I cross each time out of how many rooms exist, so the **coverage** of the set of rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>\\r\\nTartarus picks 12 rooms out of its 24 choices,<br/>so you\'ll see <b>50%</b> of the library on each run.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>\\r\\nAsphodel picks 6 rooms out of its 11 choices,<br/>so you\'ll see <b>54%</b> of the library on each run.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\"}}>\\r\\nElysium picks 8 rooms out of its 13 choices,<br/>so you\'ll see <b>61%</b> of the library on each run.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that is **by design**: a roguelike like Hades rewards learning through repetition. If you step into a completely new room you\'re not gonna feel as in control as if you step into a room you crossed 50 times already. And like most games, **Hades**\' players thrive on the power fantasy the game offers.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s very logical that the % of coverage increases across the biomes: Statistically, you\'ll see Tartarus way more than Elysium, so it makes sense that Tartarus is more diverse. Another reason would be on the production side: Hades was in early access and the later biomes came in title updates, when you don\'t necessarly have as much cooking time as for the first biomes.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n**Striking a balance between variety and familiarity on the same game system is tough, that\'s why roguelikes found a neat technique : just make two game systems on top of each other.** One is predictible (the dungeon generation) and you can learn it quickly, and the other is way more _random_ so you can\'t predict its behavior easily (the character build per run system). This separation allows the two game systems to have more focused role while complementing each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, you want players to keep building their runs on the knowledge accumulated on the first system, enough to give them the confidence to improvise and try something new in the other system. **The _variety feel_ is created by the players themselves through their engagement in a complex system, made possible by their mastery of another underlying one.**\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n<Iframe srcUrl=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aozqa_7PLhE\\" legend=\\"No Man\'s Sky claims it has over 18 quintillion planets.\\"/>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 18 quintillions planets of No Man\'s Sky are meaningless if they all play the same. The 1 billion weapons of Borderlands 3 are meaningless if they all play the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose huge numbers behind procedural generation hide the true depth of their game systems behind mathematical reasoning. **Hades** is great because many game systems introduces significant gameplay variations: the mirror of night, the weapons, the keepsakes, the boons, the pact of punishment, ... With just those, **Hades** can offer easily 1000 entirely different runs, when 99% of players won\'t go past 100.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Also: we suck at math\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may have been surprised by the gigantic numbers the different calculus outputted. The thing is: **we are really bad with dealing with huge numbers**. It\'s really difficult to get a natural hunch about combinatorics, because our brain is not natively wired for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn [indian legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_and_chessboard_problem) tells the story of the king Belbik who promised a reward for anyone who could distract him out of his boredom. The brahmin Sissa invents chess to the delight of the king, who asks Sissa how he wants be rewarded. Sissa tells the king to put one grain of rice on the first square of the chessboard, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on doubling the number of grains on each square : Sissa will only take the grains on the 64th square of the chessboard. The king is amused by this request and accept immediately. Here is what the numbers would look like on the chessboard:\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Wheat_Chessboard_with_line.svg/1024px-Wheat_Chessboard_with_line.svg.png\\" halfWidth legend=\\"You can imagine the drop of sweat on the face of the King Belbik now. (Source wikipedia)\\"/>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 64th square would contain $2^{64} = 9,223,372,036,854,775,808$ grains of rice, 10 billions of billions of grains, so 300 years at the actual rice mondial production rate! This quantity can\'t be hold on a single square since if we put the grains on the area of Paris, the layer would be 2km tall, weighing 200 billions of tons ([source](https://theconversation.com/face-au-mur-de-la-croissance-exponentielle-135331)).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king didn\'t anticipate the crazy growth of a number doubled 63 times, probably because 63 is already a big number to apprehend for us! Like the king, nowadays against the exponential growth of the pandemic or climate change, we are not equipped mentally to imagine the consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info\\r\\n\\r\\nSissa only asks for the quantity on the last square, since the last square contains as many grains as the rest of the squares on the board. Another fun and unintuitive property of this problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all have a lot of automatisms in order to simplify an issue, trying to bring it under 10 in order to solve this on our fingers. **Thus, if I come across a menu with 10 points to distribute across 5 sliders, I will see 5 choices to make, not 1 choice out of 1001 combinations**. To further cancel this potential complexity, most games won\'t allow you to reinvest freely your points into an entirely new build: you spend your points one by one, without reimbursement, so you make your way into the system, 5 choices at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs designers, programmers, game makers, ... we might know the full complexity of our systems, but we must never assume that players will or should have that knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nLike any scientific measure, sizing your game systems must be analyzed and put in context. A big number doesn\'t necessarily mean big in-game value. And that\'s what I find fascinating about game design: its _defiance_ towards mathematical logic."},{"id":"content-distribution","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/content-distribution","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-01-content-distribution.md","title":"Designing randomness: when generation is distribution","description":"Let\'s distribute cards.

It\'s so trendy, it makes your system sound so smart where you often just call `random()` a bunch of times.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image srcImage=\\"img/illustrations/wiki-procedural.png\\" altText=\\"wiki-procedural\\" legend=\\"Randomly generated redirects here. Oof.\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nI personally see _**procedural generation**_ as a glorified name to designate **a function with a small input that spits out a big output**. And for me, this is the whole point: from a minimal set of handcrafted parameters, get the maximal results you can thanks to a _procedure_, an _algorithm_, a _piece of code_, ... to avoid doing everything yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf _**procedural generation**_ is already ubiquitous in the art pipelines of most videogame/VFX/animation studio, it has also lived in the realm of game design for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this [series of short articles](/blog/tags/designing-randomness) called _**Designing randomness**_, I dive into the field of **procedural game design**.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nIn game design, _**procedural generation**_ is often focused on _**generating game content**_ : making an infinite amount of dungeons for the player to explore in a roguelike is the quintessential example, so let\'s take it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDungeons in roguelikes are not generated through some kind of superpowerful algorithm, redrawing every position of every brick to create a new yet coherent piece of architecture. The problem is much simpler, and it starts with defining a dungeon from a level design perspective:\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\", fontWeight: \\"bold\\", marginTop: \\"20px\\", fontSize: \\"18px\\" }}>\\r\\n  99,9% of the time, a dungeon is an assemblage of pre-made rooms.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerating a dungeon then becomes choosing rooms from an existing library and linking rooms with doors. Much better!\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n<Iframe srcUrl=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-HIA6-LBJc\\" legend=\\"The original programmer of Binding of Isaac on the Room Generation algorithm he conceived for the game\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nThis subspace of procedural generation, _**distributing pre-existing content**_, is well adapted to most designers\' needs. Thus, design tasks are split in two layers: **designing individuals rooms** to serve the second to second gameplay, **designing the rules of assemblage** to serve the minute to minute exploration of our dungeon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis second layer is where procedural game design takes center stage: the **use of randomness is essential** to keep the world fresh and unpredictible for players, but we still need **a level of control on the assemblage algorithm to inject level design rules** (for pacing, logic, avoiding repetition). Easier said than done! Striking a design balance between the predictability of rules and the impredictability of their random use is key to generate endless amounts of enjoyable dungeons.\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n<Iframe srcUrl=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClZe5x8Tfiw\\" legend=\\"Hades world structure uses this exact principle: a series of rooms that you cross one after the other!\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s simplify the problem a bit more: **let\'s say our dungeon is a straight corridor of 20 rooms back to back**. Our brave designer created a library of 52 rooms that can be represented by the usual poker cards. I like the card representation because I think it mimics well _the reality of content development_: you have **many ways to subdivide a given set**. In the case of cards: **suit, color, value, figures**.\\r\\n\\r\\n**This next interactive toy lets you play with 4 different ways to distribute 20 ordered cards**, 4 different ways to build a dungeon, from dumb to smart, from dead simple to not-so-simple.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the last one, I tried to strike the balance between random and rules I talked earlier by using a **constraint based algorithm (the popular Wave Function Collapse): it\'s often simpler to say to the computer what you don\'t want and then let it generate something that respects that**.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s obviously applied on a very simple problem, but it will hopefully help you grasp what is at stake when we want to distribute content in a _design-sensitive_ way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--\\r\\nnext steps :\\r\\n- [ ] card analyzer\\r\\n- [ ] dungeon analyzer (dire si r\xe9p\xe9tition)\\r\\n- [ ] fix bug: initial list of constraints is not respected\\r\\n--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n<ContentDistribution />\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>"},{"id":"science-popularization","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/science-popularization","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-28-science-popularization.md","title":"Designing information: why is it hard to communicate science","description":"Questioning the place of science in our current culture and the stakes behind its popularization.","date":"2019-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 28, 2019","tags":[{"label":"designing information","permalink":"/blog/tags/designing-information"},{"label":"science popularization","permalink":"/blog/tags/science-popularization"},{"label":"scinema","permalink":"/blog/tags/scinema"}],"readingTime":10.695,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"science-popularization","title":"Designing information: why is it hard to communicate science","draft":false,"tags":["designing information","science popularization","scinema"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Designing randomness: when generation is distribution","permalink":"/blog/content-distribution"}},"content":"Questioning the place of science in our current culture and the stakes behind its popularization.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nimport Image from \\"../src/components/Image\\";\\r\\nimport Iframe from \\"../src/components/Iframe\\";\\r\\nimport Small from \\"../src/components/Small\\";\\r\\n\\r\\n## Introduction\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image\\r\\n  srcImage=\\"img/illustrations/science-communication-graph.png\\"\\r\\n  altText=\\"science-communication-graph\\"\\r\\n  legend=\\"Schematic overview of the field and the actors of science communication according to Carsten\\r\\n  K\xf6nneker (Source: Wikipedia)\\"\\r\\n/>\\r\\n\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost ironically, science has always been a cornerstone for culture. The\\r\\nbest proof for that would be _science-fiction_ : an entire genre of\\r\\nart and creation mainly in literature and cinema based on scientific facts\\r\\nor theories to build entire worlds. It was the spectacular inventions of\\r\\nthe XIXth century that inspired Jules Verne to write marvelous adventures,\\r\\nit was the madness behind the growth of technology that inspired Philip\\r\\nK.Dick to imagine dark futures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last two centuries has more contributed to scientific knowledge than\\r\\nthe last five millenniums, advances are made everyday in multiple domains\\r\\naround the world even without _our_ knowledge, me writing this\\r\\npiece or you reading it. It has been a real challenge for education to\\r\\ndigest this knowledge and transmit it to new generations, through courses\\r\\nof course, but also through more accessible content. The Universal\\r\\nExposition was a way to show and explain scientific wonders to a large\\r\\npublic, science tv shows were ubiquitous at the birth of TV, documentaries\\r\\nhave developed rapidly in the world of cinema. However, all those\\r\\ninitiatives are insignificant compared with what the Internet did for\\r\\nscientific knowledge. All the sudden, knowledge and information from all\\r\\nover the world was accessible, readable, editable, creatable. Wikipedia is\\r\\nthe quintessential product of this incredible flow of knowledge travelling\\r\\nthrough the web.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the incredible flow of knowledge is not necessarily good\\r\\nknowledge: it\u2019s not because Internet \u201csays\u201d it that it\u2019s true. The problem\\r\\nis that the quantity of information flowing at each second is beyond\\r\\nanything that one can control, and as one saw with the recent political\\r\\nevents, \u201cfake news\u201d are spreading very easily on the social media\\r\\nlandscape. These fake news could be about anything but are often using\\r\\nfake science to appear as an authority and thus be trustworthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this paper, I will try to analyze how to communicate science and\\r\\nespecially why doing it in a better way is essential.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Communicating science today, how?\\r\\n\\r\\nTeaching is absurdly hard. Yet, educating everyone on science matters and\\r\\nissues is essential to the evolution of mankind. Teaching may be\\r\\ndifficult, but it is crucial to succeed. For what one call \u201cnatural\\r\\nsciences\u201d (mathematics, physics, biology mainly), the task is huge.\\r\\nMilleniums of knowledge must be condensed into something understandable\\r\\nand able to serve as a base for more science to grow on.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this subject, one may think of\\r\\n[Nicolas Bourbaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki). Nicolas Bourbaki is a false mathematician, created by a eponym secret\\r\\nassociation of french mathematicians in the 1950\u2019s. Their goal was to\\r\\nwrite maths books that compile all the mathematics knowledge at the time\\r\\nwith a clear structure and internal logic and a uniform writing style.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image\\r\\n  srcImage=\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Bourbaki%2C_Theorie_des_ensembles_maitrier.jpg/220px-Bourbaki%2C_Theorie_des_ensembles_maitrier.jpg\\"\\r\\n  altText=\\"Elements of mathematics\' cover\\"\\r\\n  legend=\\"Cover for \'Elements of Mathematics : Set Theory\' (Source: Wikipedia)\\"\\r\\n/>\\r\\n\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many years of preparation due to their endless debates, their\\r\\n\u201cElements of Mathematics\u201d changed the teaching of mathematics in the whole\\r\\nworld, and today, everyone math book still uses (more or less) the\\r\\nBourbaki method. Either if it\'s still relevant today or not is a debate\\r\\nfor another time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the transmission of knowledge, teaching is also about the\\r\\ntransmission of the interest/passion to the students. Curiosity is the\\r\\nmain engine that drives one\u2019s learning and since high-level science is\\r\\nbasically a huge pile of complicated stuff, it is important to suscitate\\r\\ncuriosity and fascination around it, to motivate people to gain that\\r\\nknowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here begins the story of science popularization, with the not-so-easy\\r\\ntask of bringing scientific knowledge to the masses, to spark curiosity in\\r\\ntheir hearts but that\u2019s probably too dreamy. Science popularization is\\r\\nbasically explaining the simple stuff in a fun and accessible way. Teaching can be popularization but popularization is not teaching. A popularization\\r\\nprogram is much shorter and is generally less accurate than a true lesson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, a science popularization content is constantly balancing between\\r\\naccessibility and accuracy. One can\u2019t be perfectly accurate and perfectly\\r\\naccessible : you are limited by the Pareto\u2019s limit.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image\\r\\n  srcImage=\\"img/illustrations/pareto.png\\"\\r\\n  altText=\\"pareto graph\\"\\r\\n  legend=\\"On this graph, each blue dot is a science pop. video for example.

In\\r\\naddition, a strong psychological effect is playing its part here : The\\r\\nImpostor syndrome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern in which an individual,\\r\\nin this scenario a scientist, doubts their accomplishments or their\\r\\nknowledge, convinced that they are not rightful to talk about their\\r\\nscience specialty. They focus on all the things they don\u2019t know, instead\\r\\nof seeing all the things they can actually explain very well.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the contrary, for non-scientists, another psychological syndrome can\\r\\ninfluence them : the\\r\\n[Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). This effect actually englobes the impostor syndrome but is more known\\r\\nfor the following tendency : an individual with low ability or knowledge\\r\\non something will often think having illusory superiority and will\\r\\nmistakenly evaluate their true expertise on something.\\r\\n\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\n<Image\\r\\nsrcImage=\\"https://catalogofbias.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/dk-effect-1.png\\"\\r\\naltText=\\"dunning-kruger\\"\\r\\nlegend={\\r\\n<>\\r\\nPic of <em>stupidity</em> early on, the valley of <em>despair</em> i.e.\\r\\nimpostor syndrome and the slope of enlightenment (Source:{\\" \\"}\\r\\n<a href=\\"https://catalogofbias.org/2018/03/22/twenty-years-of-bias-and-the-dunning-kruger-effect/\\">\\r\\nCatalog of Bias\\r\\n</a>\\r\\n)\\r\\n</>\\r\\n}\\r\\n/>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic application of that effect can be in every football supporter in\\r\\nthe world, thinking they could do a better job on the field when a player\\r\\nmisses a goal. But it also extends to scientific knowledge. This also\\r\\ncomes with a blur between facts and opinion on a subject, as if the\\r\\nindividual is expert enough to develop a valid opinion on the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you want to verify your opinion, you may introduce a confirmation\\r\\nbias in your research : you may focus only on the sources validating your\\r\\nthoughts and not those which contradict it. It\u2019s a classic beginner\u2019s\\r\\nmistake in science experimentation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt gets worse when you mix this with social media : the strength of\\r\\ninternet is to be a amazing field for expression, with an emphasis on\\r\\npersonal expression. Everyone can be a media. Every person on the planet\\r\\ncan be plugged, subscribed, linked to your daily thoughts and opinions.\\r\\nYour followers counter becomes a treacherous measure of the validity of\\r\\nyour sayings : you can be saying non-sense, if it has 3000 likes, that\u2019s\\r\\nlike 3000 people supporting you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paradigm of social media is to personalize your experience at an\\r\\nextreme level. On the basis of your navigation history, previous\\r\\npurchases, \u2026 very sophisticated classifiers can label you precisely :\\r\\ngender, age, sexual orientation, political orientation, interests. The\\r\\nwebsite wants you to spend time on it, thus wants to give you only the\\r\\ncontent the more adapted to your \u201cinternet personality\u201d. It basically\\r\\nencapsulate your experience with people exactly like you, with the same\\r\\nopinions and thoughts. It makes you happy but it doesn\u2019t challenge your\\r\\nmind one bit. Add the fact that you also may be exposed to viral fake\\r\\nnews, if you don\u2019t have any \u201cacquaintance\u201d in your network, that actually\\r\\ncorrect this fact, you may believe it your whole life.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\u2019s take the example of flat-earthers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlat-earth is a (surprisingly large) group of people believing that the\\r\\nEarth is flat and that all governments are lying about it. This is such an\\r\\nabsurd idea that people didn\u2019t really take them seriously and instead of\\r\\ncarefully explaining why you don\u2019t see the curvature of the globe on the\\r\\nhorizon, people made fun of them. So they started to regroup, to post on\\r\\nYouTube and social medias nearly scientific content made by them that\\r\\nfools anyone naive enough or ready to \u201cbelieve\u201d : they started a\\r\\ncommunity. This community feeds on mockery to amplify the faith of their\\r\\nmembers into this belief and to amplify the links between the members. It\\r\\nis a social organisation at its core.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch absurd conspiracy theories don\u2019t come alone : one conspiracy lead\\r\\nnaturally to another, a phenomenon that separates even more these people\\r\\nfrom the rest of the society, making a change of mind nearly impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Iframe\\r\\n  srcUrl=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8-YdgU-CF4\\"\\r\\n  width=\\"360\\"\\r\\n  height=\\"203\\"\\r\\n  legend=\\"Video from Mark Sargent about the Flat Earth \'\'\'Clues\'\'\' ... 1M views.\\"\\r\\n/>\\r\\n\\r\\nFlat Earth is born on the Internet from the incredible \u201cknowledge\u201d tools\\r\\neveryone have at their disposal : a search engine, blogs, forums, social\\r\\nnetworks. They were used in a biased way but this bias lead was reported\\r\\non their whole internet environment, making it less easy to stumble on the\\r\\nground truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recommend watching the amazing documentary Behind the Curve on Netflix\\r\\nto learn more about this subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Iframe\\r\\n  srcUrl=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nuAoQsrYJqI\\"\\r\\n  width=\\"360\\"\\r\\n  height=\\"203\\"\\r\\n  legend={\\r\\n    <>\\r\\n      Trailer for <em>Behind the Curve</em>\\r\\n    </>\\r\\n  }\\r\\n/>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Some random thoughts on \\"what-to-do-now\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first essential idea is to reconnect with people : science is not\\r\\naccessible enough, especially when you\u2019re wrong like Flat Earth. It is a\\r\\nvery difficult issue to tackle and I don\u2019t really have a magic answer.\\r\\nAccording to me, the education system in science introduce a lot of shame\\r\\n(especially in France) when you give a wrong answer, and a less fearful\\r\\nsystem may be beneficial to attract more students to science, to better\\r\\nintegrate science in culture, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn accessibility, academic science is like a menacing castle with huge\\r\\nwalls : impossible to get in and people in it look down on you. We need to\\r\\ntake down those walls and make science communication friendlier, more\\r\\nattractive. From my personal experience as a science communicator, linking\\r\\nscience to a another topic, in appearance completely out of it, is a\\r\\nworking solution. By colliding science and cinema together, I can attract\\r\\ncinema lovers to scientific topics easily. As previously said, being a\\r\\nscience communicator is less about teaching than arousing the curiosity\\r\\nfor science in general.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Iframe\\r\\n  srcUrl=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P1VW4ZhPENA\\"\\r\\n  width=\\"560\\"\\r\\n  height=\\"315\\"\\r\\n  legend=\\"My video on the analysis of fluids dynamics in the VFX industry\\"\\r\\n/>\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother idea I applied is to change the look of science. If you try to\\r\\nread a scientific paper, you may be giving up without really going into\\r\\nit. Scientific are not designers at all, and render an idea visually\\r\\ndemands time they often don\u2019t have, so most of the papers or posters are\\r\\nreally austere and poorly attractive, without even mentioning the actual\\r\\nlook of an equation, closer to hieroglyphs than words. Science\\r\\ncommunication must decipher science for the public and propose a more\\r\\nattractive look. On my channel, I use the visual esthetics of cinema to\\r\\nget unusual scientific content : by embedding scientific visuals inside a\\r\\nmovie, I can make them fun to look at in a very easy and convenient way.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, let\'s not forget the basic rules of science communication :\\r\\nalways check and show your sources, don\'t be afraid to make mistakes and\\r\\nhave the energy to correct them, submit your work to a variety of people\\r\\nto gain feedback, ... I will stop this here before it turns into a\\r\\nLinkedin motivational post.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to give an view of science communication today, what is at stake,\\r\\nwhy it is so difficult and necessary in our world context and how to maybe\\r\\nmake it better. I remind that this survey is, often like a science\\r\\ncommunication content itself, a restricted point of view on the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for reading !\\r\\n\\r\\n> Update 2021: Jesus Christ, I read that differently after the Covid pandemic \ud83d\ude10"}]}')}}]);
