          <p>Hi, I'm Jean-Baptiste, previz & game designer at Ubisoft Paris.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>I enjoy making games and experiences that makes you think differently</strong>.
            I also practice maths, graphics programming, video editing and writing as a hobbyist. I
            studied maths, physics and mechanical engineering before trying my hand in design, and
            I'm still deeply attached to science topics.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website will store various <Link to="/blog">blog posts</Link> about game design,
            science and hopefully some interactive tools/experiments to go with.
          </p>
          <p>Enjoy your stay â˜•</p>
