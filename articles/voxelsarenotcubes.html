        >famous eponym technical memo</a

      written by Alvy Ray Smith in 1995 during his time at Microsoft. Alvy Ray
      Smith is one of the co-founders of Pixar and a genius. I tried to keep the
      original text where I could! Although it still lacks illustrations
      according to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a time where voxel (or the idea that some have of voxel I should say)
      seems to be the next big thing for g@m3rz, I find interesting to dig out
      this vision again. I wrote this during my internship time at Ubisoft.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      My purpose here is to, once and for all, rid the world of the
      misconception that a pixel is a little geometric square. This is not a
      religious issue. This is an issue that strikes right at the root of
      correct image computing. The little square model is simply incorrect. It
      harms. It gets in the way. If you find yourself thinking that a pixel is a
      little square, please read this paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will have succeeded if you at least understand that you are using the
      model and why it is permissible in your case to do so (is it?).
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything I say about little squares and pixels in the 2D case applies
      equally well to little cubes and voxels in 3D. The generalization is
      straightforward, so I won’t mention it from hereon.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>The Little Square Model</h2>
    <p>
      The little square model pretends to represent a pixel (picture element) as
      a geometric square. Thus pixel (i, j) is assumed to correspond to the area
      of the plane bounded by the square {(x, y) | i-.5 £ x £ i+.5, j-.5 £ y £
      j+.5}.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already, with this simple definition, entered the territory of
      controversy—a misguided (or at least irrelevant) controversy as I will
      attempt to show. There is typically an argument about whether the pixel
      “center” lies on the integers or the half-integers. The “half-integerists”
      would have pixel (i, j) correspond instead to the area of the plane {(x,
      y) | i £ x £ i+1., j £ y £ j+1.}.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the little squares? Pixels would have edges and centers by this
      formulation.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>So, What Is a Pixel?</h2>
    <p>
      A pixel is a point sample. It exists only at a point. For a color picture,
      a pixel might actually contain three samples, one for each primary color
      contributing to the picture at the sampling point. We can still think of
      this as a point sample of a color. But we cannot think of a pixel as a
      square—or anything other than a point.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a famous theorem called the Sampling Theorem, which tells us that
      we can reconstruct a continuous entity from a discrete entity using an
      appropriate reconstruction filter. That allows us to represent an image as
      a rectilinear array of point samples (pixels!).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many types of reconstruction filter out there, and the point of
      this memo is not to detail all of them, or to explain the maths behind
      them but to show you the basics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s take a picture:
    </p>
    <img class="illustration" src="/illustrations/voxel (1).png" />

    <p>
      Our picture has here 5x4 pixels, which contain color information. To fill
      the blanks, we will use a reconstruction filter, which can be modelled
      with its footprint:
    </p>
    <img class="illustration" src="/illustrations/voxel (2).png" />
    <p>
      What this shows is that this filter will consider 5 pixels around a pixel
      center to build color inside its footprint (this is a huge simplification
      but it’s the general idea). So, when you apply a filter to each pixel, you
      get something like this:
    </p>
    <img class="illustration" src="/illustrations/voxel (3).png" />
    <p>
      So, the final image will “look” like this:
    </p>
    <img class="illustration" src="/illustrations/voxel (4).png" />

    <p>
      If we change our reconstruction filter, for a “bigger” one, one that will
      consider more pixel information to build its color, such as this one:
    </p>
    <img class="illustration" src="/illustrations/voxel (5).png" />
    <p id="40732544-9415-4c48-bfa6-9dba742c86aa" class="">
      Then the final image will “look” like this:
    </p>
    <img class="illustration" src="/illustrations/voxel (6).png" />
    <p>
      You normally <em>feel</em> that it’s a better reconstruction: there is a
      lot more overlap between each filter footprint, it will be more precise,
      just because knowledge sharing is better (image scientists could murder
      for that, but it’s the general idea).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let’s look at the worst case: a box filter. Which looks like our
      little square model right?
    </p>
    <img class="illustration" src="/illustrations/voxel (7).png" />
    <p id="8f248056-07a9-4171-8d21-5dbaa3fe784e" class="">
      Then our image is reconstructed like this:
    </p>
    <img class="illustration" src="/illustrations/voxel (8).png" />
    <p>
      It is a valid reconstruction, but very poor in quality compared to the
      other filters, resulting in “jaggies” and general “aliasing”.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>Why Is the Little square Model So Persistent?</h2>
    <p>
      I believe there are two principal reasons that the little square model
      hasn’t simply gone away:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Geometry-based computer graphics uses it</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Video magnification of computer displays appears to show it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Geometry-based computer graphics (3D synthesis, CGI, etc.) has solved some
      very difficult problems over the last four decades by assuming that the
      world they model could be divided into little squares. Rendering is the
      process of converting abstract geometry into viewable pixels that can be
      displayed on a computer screen or written to film or video for display.
    </p>
    <p>
      A modern computer graphics model can have millions of polygons
      contributing to a single image. How are all these millions of geometric
      things to be resolved into a regular array of pixels for display? Answer:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Simplify the problem by assuming the rectangular viewport on the model
        is divided regularly into little squares, one per final pixel.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Solve the often-intense hidden surface problem presented by this little
        square part of the viewport.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Average the results into a color sample.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is, of course, exactly box filtering. And it works, even though it is
      low order filtering.
    </p>
    <p>
      We probably wouldn’t be where we are today in computer graphics without
      this simplifying assumption. But, this is no reason to identify the model
      of geometric contributions to a pixel with the pixel. I often meet
      extremely intelligent and accomplished geometry-based computer graphicists
      who have leapt to the identification of the little square simplification
      with the pixel. This is not a plea for them to desist from use of the
      little square model. It is a plea for them to be aware of the
      simplification involved and to understand that the other half of computer
      picturing—the half that uses no geometry at all, the imaging half—tries to
      avoid this very simplification for quality reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      When one “magnifies” or “zooms in on” an image in most popular
      applications, each pixel appears to be a little square. The higher the
      magnification or the closer in the zoom, the bigger the little squares
      get.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I am apparently magnifying the pixel, it must be a little square,
      right? No, this is a false perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is happening when you zoom in is this: Each point sample is being
      replicated MxM times, for magnification factor M. When you look at an
      image consisting of MxM pixels all of the same color, guess what you see:
      A square of that solid color!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not an accurate picture of the pixel below. It is a bunch of pixels
      approximating what you would see if a reconstruction with a box filter
      were performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do a true zoom requires a resampling operation and is much slower than
      a video card can comfortably support in realtime today. So, the plea here
      is to please disregard the squareness of zoomed in “pixels”. You are
      really seeing an MxM array of point samples, not a single point sample
      rendered large.
    </p>
    <p>
      But wait a minute: my monitor is made of pixels, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well. Many people are aware that a color monitor often has little triads
      of dots that cause the perception of color at normal viewing distances.
      There is no fixed mapping between triads and pixels driving them. The
      easiest way to understand this is to consider your own graphics card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most modern cards support a variety of different color resolutions—eg,
      640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, etc. The number of triads on your display
      screen do not change as you change the number of pixels driving them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have presented a brief but inclusive analysis of sampling and filtering.
      It has been shown that the little square model does not arise naturally in
      sampling theory, the main underpinning of everything we do. The geometry
      world uses it a great deal because they have had to simplify in order to
      accomplish. Their simplified model of contributions to a pixel should not
      be confused with or identified with the pixel. Magnified screen pixels
      that look like little squares have been shown to be a quick and dirty
      trick (pixel replication) by graphics boards designers, but not the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the little square model should be suspect whenever it is
      encountered. It should be used with great care, if at all, and certainly
      not offered to the world as “standard” in image computing.

      <strong>Conclusion: A Voxel is </strong><em><strong>not</strong></em
      ><strong> a little cube!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This part is me (JB Siraudin) writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have found the previous part a little obscure. After all,
      simplifying a pixel to a little square didn’t hurt <em>that</em> much the
      computer graphics industry or the video game industry. Many sampling or
      anti-aliasing strategies made up for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let’s take voxels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voxels are not cubes. Voxels are points on 3D grid. It is
      <em>simple</em> to represent them like cubes but they can be in any shape.
      If I don’t think the little square model is dangerous anymore, cubic
      voxels shouldn’t be the norm. Our mental shape of a voxel is determined by
      voxelart and Minecraft whereas we should turn to fluid simulation as an
      example of good use of voxels.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we think of voxels as 3d points for sampling methods, they can be
      applied on top of practically any 3D representation technique, like
      polygon meshes. In fact, it’s already used in advanced lighting
      algorithms. Just as pixels, one could imagine reconstruction filters for
      remeshing voxellised shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vision of voxels at Ubisoft is to consider them as atoms to run large
      and “accurate” physics simulations to create more believable worlds and
      better sandboxes. I’m not saying voxels is a bad idea to accomplish this
      vision. I’m saying we can do it without seeing cubes everywhere. And also,
      not all physics simulations are made to run with an “atomic” model.
    </p>
    <p>
      One must think of voxels as a shape for data storage and data
      manipulation, not as a 3D shape. And this is all what matters for future
      world building and simulation: data transformation. Voxels could be a
      strong basis for this, or not. The real future of video game for Ubisoft
      is not <em>voxels</em>, it’s <em>data-oriented design</em>. Where data is
      the basis of the engine, where multiple simulations can run on the same
      set of data so you don’t need to manually create links between systems. I
      believe <em>this</em> is the key to create complex intricate systems, not
      to modelize everything in the world as little cubes.
