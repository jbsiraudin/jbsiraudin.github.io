    <h1>Let's talk about education and computer science</h1>
    <h3>By <em>Jean-Baptiste Siraudin</em> - 22.04.2019</h3>

    <p>Boy, oh, boy. That's a tricky subject.</p>
    <p>
      Please keep in mind that I am still a <em>student</em> in that matter, so
      I have a very limited view on the subject. But this matter bugs my mind
      for several months now.

    <p>
      Computer science is everywhere now and and everything around computer
      science (ie languages, editors, ...) seems to be (pardon my french) the
      biggest shit show ever, at least for someone kinda <em>in</em> the
      industry like me. Churches of thought are endlessly fighting each other,
      filling Twitter with sarcasm and despair. This is not the real issue here.
      My real issue is the lack of communication and education on those matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      I come from a weird French school called Ecole polytechnique. Very famous
      in France and highly praised internationally for its students. I took
      several computer science class
