    <h1>Let's talk about education and computer science</h1>
    <h3>By <em>Jean-Baptiste Siraudin</em> - 22.04.2019</h3>

    <p>Boy, oh, boy. That's a tricky subject.</p>
    <p>
      Please keep in mind that I am still a <em>student</em> in that matter, so
      I have a very limited view on the subject. But this matter bugs my mind
      for several months now.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Computer science is everywhere now and and everything around computer
      science (ie languages, editors, ...) seems to be the biggest shit show
      ever, at least for someone kinda <em>in</em> the industry like me.
      Churches of thought are endlessly fighting each other, filling Twitter
      with sarcasm and despair. This is not the real issue here. My real issue
      is the lack of communication and education on those matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      I come from a weird French school called Ecole polytechnique. Very famous
      in France and highly praised internationally for its students. I took
      several computer science class
    </p>

    <p>
      For this meal, you'll need: 1kg potatoes, 500ml milk or cream, 1 garlic
      clove, fresh thyme, grated nutmeg.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rub some butter all over the surface of a gratin dish. Peel and slice the
      potatoes thin. Lay the slices on a clean tea towel and pat dry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pour the milk and cream into a saucepan. Add the garlic, thyme and nutmeg.
      Slowly heat the milk and, just as it is about to reach boiling point and
      you see bubbles appearing around the edge of the pan, remove it from the
      heat. Keep warm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Layer the potato slices in the dish, slightly overlapping the slices and
      sprinkling with a little salt, freshly ground pepper and grated garlic
      between each layer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pour the hot milk and cream over the potatoes, then repeat the
      layering/pouring operation until the end. Scatter some cheese over the top
      and bake at medium temperature for about one hour. Leave the dish to stand
      for about 5 minutes, then serve sprinkled with a few fresh thyme leaves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Et voil√† ! I hope you enjoyed this recipe. I promise the next article will
      be about something.
