      Schematic overview of the field and the actors of science communication
      according to Carsten Könneker (Source: Wikipedia)
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost ironically, science has always been a cornerstone for culture. The
      best proof for that would be <em>science-fiction</em> : an entire genre of
      art and creation mainly in literature and cinema based on scientific facts
      or theories to build entire worlds. It was the spectacular inventions of
      the XIXth century that inspired Jules Verne to write marvelous adventures,
      it was the madness behind the growth of technology that inspired Philip
      K.Dick to imagine dark futures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last two centuries has more contributed to scientific knowledge than
      the last five millenniums, advances are made everyday in multiple domains
      around the world even without <em>our</em> knowledge, me writing this
      piece ou you reading it. It has been a real challenge for education to
      digest this knowledge and transmit it to new generations, through courses
      of course, but also through more accessible content. The Universal
      Exposition was a way to show and explain scientific wonders to a large
      public, science tv shows were ubiquitous at the birth of TV, documentaries
      have developed rapidly in the world of cinema. However, all those
      initiatives are insignificant compared with what the Internet did for
      scientific knowledge. All the sudden, knowledge and information from all
      over the world was accessible, readable, editable, creatable. Wikipedia is
      the quintessential product of this incredible flow of knowledge travelling
      through the web.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the incredible flow of knowledge is not necessarily good
      knowledge: it’s not because Internet “says” it that it’s true. The problem
      is that the quantity of information flowing at each second is beyond
      anything that one can could control, and as one saw with the recent
      political events, “fake news” are spreading very easily on the social
      media landscape. These fake news could be about anything but are often
      using fake science to appear as an authority and thus be trustworthy.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this paper, I will try to analyze how to communicate science and
      especially why doing it in a better way is essential.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Communicating science today, how?</h2>
    <p>
      Teaching is absurdly hard. Yet, educating everyone on science matters and
      issues is essential to the evolution of mankind. Teaching may be
      difficult, but it is crucial to succeed. For what one call “natural
      sciences” (mathematics, physics, biology mainly), the task is huge.
      Milleniums of knowledge must be condensed into something understandable
      and able to serve as a base for more science to grow on.
    </p>

    <p>
      On this subject, one may think of
      <a
        class="externlink"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki"
        >Nicolas Bourbaki</a
      >. Nicolas Bourbaki is a false mathematician, created by a eponym secret
      association of french mathematicians in the 1950’s. Their goal was to
      write maths books that compile all the mathematics knowledge at the time
      with a clear structure and internal logic and a uniform writing style.
    </p>
    <br />

      alt="Elements of mathematics' cover"
    />
    <p class="legend">

    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      After many years of preparation due to their endless debates, their
      “Elements of Mathematics” changed the teaching of mathematics in the whole
      world, and today, everyone math book still uses (more or less) the
      Bourbaki method. Either if it's still relevant today or not is a debate
      for another time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the transmission of knowledge, teaching is also about the
      transmission of the interest/passion to the students. Curiosity is the
      main engine that drives one’s learning and since hugh-level science is
      basically a huge pile of complicated stuff, it is important to suscitate
      curiosity and fascination around it, to motivate people to gain that
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here begins the story of science popularization, with the not-so-easy
      task of bringing scientific knowledge to the masses, to spark curiosity in
      their hearts but that’s probably too dreamy. Science popularization is
      basically explaining stuff in a fun and accessible way. Teaching can be
      popularization but popularization is not teaching. A popularization
      program is much shorter and is generally less accurate than a true lesson.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, a science popularization content is constantly balancing between
      accessibility and accuracy. One can’t be perfectly accurate and perfectly
      accessible : you are limited by the Pareto’s limit.

    <p>
      In a famous BBC interview, when Richard Feynman is asked about magnetism,
      why two magnets repel each other, he admits not knowing how to answer the
      question. Not because he doesn’t have the knowledge - he was probably the
      greatest erudite in physics at his time - but because he doesn’t know his
      public : “<em
        >When you explain a “why?”, you have to be in some framework that you
        allow something to be true. Otherwise you’re perpetually asking
        “why?”.</em
      >” Thus, your position on the graph essentially depends on your target,
      not on you.

    <p>
      As a consequence, science popularization is always hiding information : it
      is lying. BUT it is the truth in a certain framework, not a certain
      <em>opinion</em>, and most importantly it doesn’t contradict or betray the
      ground truth.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>
      If science tells the <em>truth</em>, why is it so difficult to communicate
      that?
    </h2>
    <p>
      You realize now that, even with science communication, the notion of truth
      is tricky : it is always a truth, based on the context of the
      communication, on the public, not necessarily the whole truth. This makes
      science communication difficult for those who are not used to it. In
      addition, a strong psychological effect is playing its part here : The
      Impostor syndrome.
    </p>

    <p>
      The impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern in which an individual,
      in this scenario a scientist, doubts their accomplishments or their
      knowledge, convinced that they are not rightful to talk about their
      science specialty. They focus on all the things they don’t know, instead
      of seeing all the things they can actually explain very well.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the contrary, for non-scientists, another psychological syndrome can
      influence them : the
      <a
        class="externlink"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"
        >Dunning-Kruger effect</a
      >. This effect actually englobes the impostor syndrome but is more known
      for the following tendency : an individual with low ability or knowledge
      on something will often think having illusory superiority and will
      mistakenly evaluate their true expertise on something.

        >Catalog of Bias</a
      >)
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic application of that effect can be in every football supporter in
      the world, thinking they could do a better job on the field when a player
      misses a goal. But it also extends to scientific knowledge. This also
      comes with a blur between facts and opinion on a subject, as if the
      individual is expert enough to develop a valid opinion on the matter.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you want to verify your opinion, you may introduce a confirmation
      bias in your research : you may focus only on the sources validating your
      thoughts and not those which contradict it. It’s a classic beginner’s
      mistake in science experimentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      It gets worse when you mix this with social media : the strength of
      internet is to be a amazing field for expression, with an emphasis on
      personal expression. Everyone can be a media. Every person on the planet
      can be plugged, subscribed, linked to your daily thoughts and opinions.
      Your followers counter becomes a treacherous measure of the validity of
      your sayings : you can be saying non-sense, if it has 3000 likes, that’s
      like 3000 people supporting you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paradigm of social media is to personalize your experience at an
      extreme level. On the basis of your navigation history, previous
      purchases, … very sophisticated classifiers can label you precisely :
      gender, age, sexual orientation, political orientation, interests. The
      website wants you to spend time on it, thus wants to give you only the
      content the more adapted to your “internet personality”. It basically
      encapsulate your experience with people exactly like you, with the same
      opinions and thoughts. It makes you happy but it doesn’t challenge your
      mind one bit. Add the fact that you also may be exposed to viral fake
      news, if you don’t have any “acquaintance” in your network, that actually
      correct this fact, you may believe it your whole life.

    <p>Let’s take the example of flat-earthers.</p>
    <p>
      Flat-earth is a (surprisingly large) group of people believing that the
      Earth is flat and that all governments are lying about it. This is such an
      absurd idea that people didn’t really take them seriously and instead of
      carefully explaining why you don’t see the curvature of the globe on the
      horizon, people made fun of them. So they started to regroup, to post on
      YouTube and social medias nearly scientific content made by them that
      fools anyone naive enough or ready to “believe” : they started a
      community. This community feeds on mockery to amplify the faith of their
      members into this belief and to amplify the links between the members. It
      is a social organisation at its core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such absurd conspiracy theories don’t come alone : one conspiracy lead
      naturally to another, a phenomenon that separates even more these people
      from the rest of the society, making a change of mind nearly impossible.

      Flat Earth is born on the Internet from the incredible “knowledge” tools
      everyone have at their disposal : a search engine, blogs, forums, social
      networks. They were used in a biased way but this bias lead was reported
      on their whole internet environment, making it less easy to stumble on the
      ground truth.

      I recommend watching the amazing documentary Behind the Curve on Netflix
      to learn more about this subject.

    <h2>Some random thoughts on "what-to-do-now"</h2>
    <p>
      The first essential idea is to reconnect with people : science is not
      accessible enough, especially when you’re wrong like Flat Earth. It is a
      very difficult issue to tackle and I don’t really have a magic answer.
      According to me, the education system in science introduce a lot of shame
      (especially in France) when you give a wrong answer, and a less fearful
      system may be beneficial to attract more students to science, to better
      integrate science in culture, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      On accessibility, academic science is like a menacing castle with huge
      walls : impossible to get in and people in it look down on you. We need to
      take down those walls and make science communication friendlier, more
      attractive. From my personal experience as a science communicator, linking
      science to a another topic, in appearance completely out of it, is a
      working solution. By colliding science and cinema together, I can attract
      cinema lovers to scientific topics easily. As previously said, being a
      science communicator is less about teaching than arousing the curiosity
      for science in general.

      A comparison between Pixar's animation and my own version I did for
      explaining acoustics phenomenon
    </p>
    <p>
      Another idea I applied is to change the look of science. If you try to
      read a scientific paper, you may be giving up without really going into
      it. Scientific are not designers at all, and render an idea visually
      demands time they often don’t have, so most of the papers or posters are
      really austere and poorly attractive, without even mentioning the actual
      look of an equation, closer to hieroglyphs than words. Science
      communication must decipher science for the public and propose a more
      attractive look. On my channel, I use the visual esthetics of cinema to
      get unusual scientific content : by embedding scientific visuals inside a
      movie, I can make them fun to look at in a very easy and convenient way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, let's not forget the basic rules of science communication :
      always check and show your sources, don't be afraid to make mistakes and
      have the energy to correct them, submit your work to a variety of people
      to gain feedback, ... I will stop this here before it turns into a
      Linkedin motivational post.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      I tried to give an view of science communication today, what is at stake,
      why it is so difficult and necessary in our world context and how to maybe
      make it better. I remind that this survey is, often like a science
      communication content itself, a restricted point of view on the truth.
