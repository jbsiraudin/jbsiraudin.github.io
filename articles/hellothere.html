    <h1>Well, hello there</h1>
    <h3>By <em>Jean-Baptiste Siraudin</em> - 11.04.2019</h3>

    <p>
      Like a General Kenobi inexplicably jumping into a separatist meeting, here
      I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      All first article on a <em>pro</em> blog is completely useless and you
      know it. And yet, you clicked on it. To discover my conception of the
      "Hello world", I guess.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Since you're here, I don't want to waste your time (or mine by making huge
      efforts to make this nearly interesting), I present you the recipe of one
      of my favorite meal : the <em>gratin dauphinois</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this meal, you'll need: 1kg potatoes, 500ml milk or cream, 1 garlic
      clove, fresh thyme, grated nutmeg.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rub some butter all over the surface of a gratin dish. Peel and slice the
      potatoes thin. Lay the slices on a clean tea towel and pat dry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pour the milk and cream into a saucepan. Add the garlic, thyme and nutmeg.
      Slowly heat the milk and, just as it is about to reach boiling point and
      you see bubbles appearing around the edge of the pan, remove it from the
      heat. Keep warm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Layer the potato slices in the dish, slightly overlapping the slices and
      sprinkling with a little salt, freshly ground pepper and grated garlic
      between each layer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pour the hot milk and cream over the potatoes, then repeat the
      layering/pouring operation until the end. Scatter some cheese over the top
      and bake at medium temperature for about one hour. Leave the dish to stand
      for about 5 minutes, then serve sprinkled with a few fresh thyme leaves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Et voil√† ! I hope you enjoyed this recipe. I promise the next article will
      be about something.
